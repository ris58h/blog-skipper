Blog Skipper is a Web Extension to skip longreads and comment threads. It works great for 'holy wars' and won't let your fingers get tired \o/.

HOW TO USE IT
There are several ways to skip:
- Middle-click on a part of an article or a comment thread you want to skip (enabled by default; you can change it on the extension's options page).
- Right-click on a part of an article or a comment thread you want to skip. In the context menu click 'Skip' (disabled by default; you can change it on the extension's options page).
- Click on the extension's icon in the top right corner.
- Use shortcuts ('z' for 'Skip' and 'Z' for 'Undo'; you can change it on the extension's options pag).
'Skip' action scrolls a page to the next header in case of article click or to the next comment tree (last comment if there is no next comment tree) in case of comment click.
Use 'Undo' action if you want to return back to the position you skipped from (to enable it go to the extension's options page).

NOTE
Non-mouse-based skipping may not work properly on pages with iframes.

SITES
Blog Skipper automatically detects comments on sites, but you can define CSS-selectors for comments on the extension's options page (basic CSS knowledge is required).
