Blog Skipper is a Web Extension to skip longreads and comment threads. It works great for 'holy wars' and won't let your fingers get tired \o/.

HOW TO USE IT
Middle-click on a part of an article or a comment thread you want to skip.
Right-click on a part of an article or a comment thread you want to skip. In the context menu click 'Skip' (disabled by default; you can change it on the extension's options page).
It scrolls a page to the next header in case of article click or to the next comment tree (last comment if there is no next comment tree) in case of comment click.
Use 'Undo' action if you want to return back to the place you skipped from (take a look at the extension's options page).

SITES
Blog Skipper automatically detects comments on sites, but you can define CSS-selectors for comments on the extension's options page (basic CSS knowledge is required).
