# About
Blog Skipper is a Web Extension to skip longreads and comment threads. It works great for 'holy wars' and won't let your fingers get tired \o/.

# Get
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blog-skipper/chjnbemclefhkdeihphnkkgacddeejom)

[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blog-skipper/)

# How to use it
## Mouse
Right-click on a part of an article or a comment thread you want to skip. In the context menu click 'Skip'. It'll scroll the page to the next header in case of article click or to the next comment tree (last comment if there is no next comment tree) in case of comment click.

## Keyboard
There are shortcuts, which is great for [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/) (or other similar extensions) users! Defaults are 'z' for Skip and 'Z' for Undo (move to the position before Skip). You can reassign them on the extension's options page.

## Note
Comment skipping is available only for several sites (like YouTube, Reddit, Disqus, Hacker News and etc.) but you can manage it on the extension's options page (basic CSS knowledge is required).
